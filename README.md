# React.js and Express.js with MySQL App

This is a sample application built using React.js for the frontend and Express.js with MySQL for the backend. It includes features such as user authentication, product management, and form validation.

## Frontend (React.js)

### LoginForm Component
- Create a new React component called "LoginForm" that includes a form with fields for username and password.
- Implement form validation for the "LoginForm" component. Display an error message if the username or password is empty.

### Dashboard Component
- Create a new React component called "Dashboard" that displays a welcome message for the authenticated user.
- Implement authentication using React Router. Create a private route that renders the "Dashboard" component only if the user is authenticated. Otherwise, redirect the user to the login page.

### ProductList Component
- Create a React component called "ProductList" that fetches and displays a list of products from the backend.

### CreateProductForm Component
- Add functionality to create a new product.
- Create a React component called "CreateProductForm" that includes fields for the product name, price, and description.
- When the form is submitted, send a POST request to the backend to create the product.

### Updating and Deleting Products
- Implement updating and deleting products.
- For each product displayed in the "ProductList" component, add buttons to edit and delete the product.
- When the edit button is clicked, display a form with the product's current details that allows the user to update the information.
- When the delete button is clicked, send a DELETE request to the backend to delete the product.

## Backend (Express.js with MySQL)

### Server Setup
- Set up an Express.js server with MySQL as the database.
- Connect to the database using the appropriate credentials.

### User Management
- Create a "users" table in the database with columns for username and password.
- Implement a signup route to allow users to create an account.
- Implement a login route to handle user authentication. Verify the username and password against the values stored in the "users" table.

### Product Management
- Create a "products" table in the database with columns for name, price, and description.
- Implement the following endpoints:
  - GET /products: Retrieve all products from the database.
  - POST /products: Create a new product in the database.
  - GET /products/:id: Retrieve a specific product by its ID from the database.
  - PUT /products/:id: Update a specific product by its ID in the database.
  - DELETE /products/:id: Delete a specific product by its ID from the database.

### Authentication Middleware
- Add authentication middleware to protect the product endpoints.
- Only authenticated users should be able to access and modify products.
